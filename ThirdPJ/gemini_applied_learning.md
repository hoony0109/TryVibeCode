-   **D2: Spatial:** Local vs. global manifestations. (W:_, I:_)
-   **D3: Abstraction:** Concrete examples and abstract principles. (W:_, I:_)
-   **D4: Causal:** Root causes and ultimate effects. (W:_, I:_)
-   **D5: Hierarchical:** Micro, meso, and macro level views. (W:_, I:_)
**Result (MDA):** Synthesize the weighted insights into a comprehensive analysis.

### 3. Creative Connection Matrix
**Purpose:** To find creative and non-obvious connections between two concepts.
**Command: `ConnectCreatively`**
**Concept A:** `[Specify Concept A]`
**Concept B:** `[Specify Concept B]`
1.  **Intersection (A ∩ B):** What are the common elements?
2.  **Difference (A ⊕ B):** What are the unique elements?
3.  **Transition (f(A→B)):** How can A transform into B? Explore:
    -   Direct & Indirect links
    -   Paradoxical connections
    -   Metaphorical bridges
    -   Systemic relationships
**Creative Connection (CC):** Summarize the most creative link found.

### 4. Problem Redefinition Algorithm
**Purpose:** To reframe a problem to unlock new solution paths.
**Command: `RedefineProblem`**
**Initial Problem (P₀):** `[State the problem]`
Apply the following redefinition techniques:
-   **Rotate:** View the problem from an opposite or inverted perspective.
-   **Scale:** Zoom in on a small component and zoom out to the larger system.
-   **Move:** Shift to a higher or lower conceptual level.
-   **Transfer:** Frame the problem in a completely different domain (e.g., biology, art).
**Redefined Problem (PR):** State the new, reframed problem.

### 5. Innovative Solution Generation Formula
**Purpose:** To brainstorm innovative solutions by using diverse creative methods.
**Command: `GenerateInnovation`**
**Problem:** `[State the problem]`
Generate solutions using these methods, evaluating each for Novelty (N), Feasibility (F), Value (V), and Risk (R):
-   **Combine:** Mix existing elements in new ways.
-   **Borrow:** Adapt a solution from an unrelated field.
-   **Embrace Constraints:** Use a limitation as a core feature.
-   **Reverse:** Think of the opposite of the conventional solution.
-   **Redesign:** Re-imagine the entire system from scratch.
**Innovative Solution (IS):** Propose the best solution based on the evaluation.

### 6. Insight Amplification Formula
**Purpose:** To deepen and expand an initial insight.
**Command: `AmplifyInsight`**
**Initial Insight (I₀):** `[State the insight]`
Amplify it using these steps:
-   **Iteration:** Ask "Why?" five times to find the root.
-   **Collaboration:** Consider 3 different expert perspectives (e.g., artist, engineer, child).
-   **Questioning:** Ask "What if...?" and "How might we...?" to explore possibilities.
-   **Analogy:** Find a powerful analogy for the insight.
**Amplified Insight (IA):** State the richer, deeper insight.

### 7. Thinking Evolution Equation
**Purpose:** To create a continuous improvement plan for understanding a topic.
**Command: `EvolveThinking`**
**Topic:** `[Specify Topic]`
**Initial Thought (T₀):** `[State current understanding]`
Create a plan to evolve this thinking:
-   **Learning (L):** What key information or sources should I consume?
-   **Experience (E):** What practical experiments can I run to test my understanding?
-   **Reflection (R):** What questions should I regularly ask myself about this topic?
**Evolution Path (TE):** Summarize the learning and growth plan.

### 8. Complexity Solving Matrix
**Purpose:** To systematically deconstruct and solve a complex problem.
**Command: `SolveComplexity`**
**Complex Problem:** `[Describe the complex system/problem]`
1.  **Deconstruct:** Break the problem into its primary sub-components.
2.  **Map Relationships:** Diagram the interactions and interdependencies.
3.  **Identify Leverage Points:** Find which components have the most influence.
